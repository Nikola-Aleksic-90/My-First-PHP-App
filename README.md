My first PHP app.

This app is a simple Job Application app. Entire project's purpose is to demonstrate my PHP skill after finishing Udemy course for PHP + MySQL. It is demonstrating my entry level PHP and HTML coding skills and practices so dont expect much. There won't be SQL in this app. I will probably add it sometime in the future.

Project will have several versions, each adding a little bit of code.

Versions are:

v1.0 This will just be HTML code to set overall frame and location of components on page and to set names of variables.
